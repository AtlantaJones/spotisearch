SpotiSearch
===========

This is a basic tool for generating advanced search queries in Spotify. There are a lot of ways to search for music on Spotify, but (to date), it lacks an "advanced search" function.

This utility is built with HTML, CSS and jQuery to help build advanced queries that you can then paste into Spotify's search field. 

Development has just begun on this, but I'll eventually put up a functioning hosted site. 

Cheers,
